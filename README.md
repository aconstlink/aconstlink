## Hi there, I am Alex ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ This is my Github page where you will find all my endeavors into programming.

I am mainly working on real-time audio/visual [demos](https://github.com/aconstlink/motor_demos) :zap: using my real-time 2d/3d game engine [motor](https://github.com/aconstlink/motor). :construction_worker:

I do successless :dizzy: but regular streaming :boom: over at [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/aconstlink) in case you would like to follow the progression. :sparkles:
