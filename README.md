## Hi there, I am Alex ðŸ‘‹

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ This is my Github page where you will find all my endeavors into my software projects.

I used to work professionally as a software developer but since my first child was born, thinks went south programming wise. But I try to code as much as possible during the time I have a day and share things here!
